  "mfcc": {
    "name": "MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)",
    "explanation": "Represents the short-term power spectrum of a sound based on a linear cosine transform of a log power spectrum on a nonlinear Mel scale of frequency. Essentially, it captures the timbral or 'sound color' characteristics relevant to human hearing. Useful for distinguishing instruments, identifying genres, or speech recognition."
  },
  "energy": {
    "name": "Energy",
    "explanation": "Measures the overall loudness or intensity of the audio signal. It's calculated as the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the signal amplitude over a short frame. Higher energy usually corresponds to louder sections."
  },
  "entropy": {
    "name": "Zero-Crossing Rate Entropy",
    "explanation": "Measures the entropy (randomness or unpredictability) of the Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR). ZCR itself indicates how often the signal crosses the zero axis. High entropy might suggest more complex or noisy signals, while low entropy could indicate more tonal or periodic sounds."
  },
  "key": {
    "name": "Key & Scale",
    "explanation": "Estimates the musical key (e.g., C, G#, Eb) and scale (e.g., Major, Minor) of the audio segment. It analyzes the pitch content and harmony to determine the most likely tonal center. Key Strength indicates the confidence of the estimation."
  },
  "dynamicComplexity": {
    "name": "Dynamic Complexity",
    "explanation": "Measures the variation in loudness throughout the piece. Higher values indicate frequent or significant changes in volume (dynamics), often found in expressive classical music or complex arrangements. Lower values suggest more consistent loudness, common in some pop or electronic genres. It's related to the standard deviation of loudness levels."
  },
  "rms": {
    "name": "RMS (Root Mean Square)",
    "explanation": "Represents the average power or intensity of the audio signal, closely related to perceived loudness over a given time window. Similar to Energy, but often calculated over longer segments or the entire track for overall level assessment."
  },
  "tuningFrequency": {
    "name": "Tuning Frequency & Cents",
    "explanation": "Estimates the reference tuning frequency (often around A4 = 440 Hz) used in the recording. It analyzes the pitch content to find the most prominent tuning standard. 'Tuning Cents' shows the deviation from the standard 440 Hz tuning in cents (100 cents = 1 semitone)."
  },
  "rhythm": {
      "name": "Rhythm (BPM, Confidence)",
      "explanation": "Extracts beat positions and estimates the overall tempo in Beats Per Minute (BPM) using the RhythmExtractor2013 algorithm. Confidence value indicates the reliability of the beat detection (0 if using 'degara' method)."
  },
  "onsetRate": {
      "name": "Onset Rate",
      "explanation": "Computes the average number of detected musical onsets (note starts, drum hits) per second across the entire signal. Indicates the rhythmic density or 'busyness'. Requires a 44100Hz sample rate."
  },
  "danceability": {
      "name": "Danceability",
      "explanation": "Estimates how suitable the audio is for dancing based on Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) of rhythm consistency. Higher values (typically 0-3) indicate more danceable tracks."
  },
  "intensity": {
      "name": "Intensity (Categorical)",
      "explanation": "Classifies the overall perceived intensity of the audio as Relaxed (-1), Moderate (0), or Aggressive (1). This is a categorical feature."
  },
  "spectralCentroidTime": {
      "name": "Spectral Centroid (Time)",
      "explanation": "Calculated in the time domain. Represents the 'center of mass' of the signal's energy after filtering. Related to perceived brightness. Mean and Standard Deviation are computed over frames."
  },
  "spectralComplexity": {
      "name": "Spectral Complexity",
      "explanation": "Measures complexity based on the number of peaks in the spectrum. Higher values indicate more complex spectra. Mean and Standard Deviation are computed over frames."
  },
  "spectralContrast": {
      "name": "Spectral Contrast",
      "explanation": "Computes the difference between peaks and valleys in different frequency bands of the spectrum. Relates to textural clarity. Mean and Standard Deviation vectors (one value per band) are computed over frames."
  },
  "inharmonicity": {
      "name": "Inharmonicity",
      "explanation": "Measures the divergence of spectral peaks from perfect multiples of the fundamental frequency. Ranges from 0 (harmonic) to 1 (inharmonic). Requires peak detection. Mean and Standard Deviation are computed over frames."
  },
  "dissonance": {
      "name": "Dissonance",
      "explanation": "Estimates perceptual roughness based on interactions between spectral peaks. Ranges from 0 (consonant) to 1 (dissonant). Requires peak detection. Mean and Standard Deviation are computed over frames."
  },
  "melBands": {
      "name": "Mel Bands",
      "explanation": "Computes the energy in frequency bands spaced according to the Mel scale (approximating human pitch perception). Provides detailed spectral shape information. Mean and Standard Deviation vectors (one value per band) are computed over frames."
  },
  "pitchSalience": {
      "name": "Pitch Salience",
      "explanation": "Measures the prominence or clarity of pitch in the spectrum. Ranges from 0 (unpitched) to 1 (strong pitch). Mean and Standard Deviation are computed over frames."
  },
  "spectralFlux": {
      "name": "Spectral Flux",
      "explanation": "Measures the rate of change in the shape of the spectrum from one frame to the next. High flux indicates rapid timbral changes. Mean and Standard Deviation are computed over frames."
